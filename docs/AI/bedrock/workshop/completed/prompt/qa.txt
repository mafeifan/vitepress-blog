Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies including AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and Amazon, along with a broad set of capabilities that you need to build generative AI applications, simplifying development while maintaining privacy and security. With Amazon Bedrock’s comprehensive capabilities, you can easily experiment with a variety of top FMs, customize them privately with your data using techniques such as fine tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and create managed agents that execute complex business tasks—from booking travel and processing insurance claims to creating ad campaigns and managing inventory—all without writing any code. Since Amazon Bedrock is serverless, you don't have to manage any infrastructure, and  you can securely integrate and deploy generative AI capabilities into your applications using the AWS services you are already familiar with.

Amazon Bedrock customers can choose from some of the most cutting-edge FMs available today. This includes Anthropic's Claude, AI21 Labs' Jurassic-2, Stability AI's Stable Diffusion, Cohere's Command and Embed, Meta's Llama 2, and the Amazon Titan language and embeddings models.

Choice of leading foundation models: Amazon Bedrock offers an easy-to-use developer experience to work with a broad range of high-performing FMs from Amazon and leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, and Stability AI. You can quickly experiment with a variety of FMs in the playground, and use a single API for inference regardless of the models you choose, giving you the flexibility to use FMs from different providers and keep up to date with the latest model versions with minimal code changes.

Data security and compliance certifications: Amazon Bedrock offers several capabilities to support security and privacy requirements, and has achieved HIPAA eligibility and GDPR compliance. With Amazon Bedrock, your content is not used to improve the base models and is not shared with third-party model providers. Your data in Amazon Bedrock is always encrypted in transit and at rest, and you can optionally encrypt the data using your own keys. You can use AWS PrivateLink with Amazon Bedrock to establish private connectivity between your FMs and your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) without exposing your traffic to the Internet.

AWS and the third-party model providers will not use any inputs to or outputs from Bedrock to train Amazon Titan or any third-party models.

User inputs and model outputs are not shared with third-party model providers.

Amazon Bedrock offers several capabilities to support security and privacy requirements and is compatible with common compliance standards including GDPR and HIPAA. As with all AWS services, you get the standard AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls for authentication and AWS CloudTrail for auditing API activity. All your data is encrypted at rest using your own AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys, which provides full control and visibility into how your data and custom models are being stored and accessed. With PrivateLink, you can pass your data on AWS to Amazon Bedrock exclusively through AWS and never through public internet. Amazon Bedrock can also attach its training instances to your Amazon VPC in order to read from and write data to Amazon S3.
