Dear Acme Investments,
I am writing to bring to your attention a situation that I believe to be unethical on the part of one of your account managers, Roger Longbottom.
I recently met with Roger to discuss my investment portfolio and was deeply concerned to hear that he suggested I invest in a certain stock. When I asked him why he thought this was a good investment, he stated that the stock was currently undervalued and was likely to increase in value in the near future.
However, upon further research, I have discovered that the stock in question has a questionable reputation. It has been the subject of multiple lawsuits and has been found to have engaged in questionable business practices.
I believe Roger was aware of these facts, but failed to disclose them to me. As a result, I feel I was misled into making an unwise investment decision.
I therefore urge you to investigate whether Roger has acted unethically and take appropriate action if necessary.
Yours sincerely,
Carson Bradford
